            Have you ever wished that Athkatla were a little livelier? Ever
            wanted to know how Biff ended up as the understudy? Wished that the
            shopkeepers had more than two lines apiece? Had lives of their own?<br /><br />
            Ever wished you could buy some Boots of Speed that looked a bit
            more, well, dashing? Thought about buying Imoen some pink Boots of
            Stealth? Wanted to use the Stinking Cloud that must form around
            your party after days of travel and no baths for some truly
            <em>useful</em> purpose?<br /><br />
            Waste no more time on wishing!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Now that Aurora is here, you can have all these things and
            more!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Aurora's Shoes and Boots introduces more than two dozen new pairs
            of boots that are both useful and stylish. In addition, Aurora
            herself is there to add a bit of spice to Athkatlan life. She'll
            chat with you about nobles and commoners alike, providing exciting
            (if not always accurate) information about their daily lives.

            You will also meet the shop's nighttime attendant, the surly gnome
            Tomthal, doomed to the surface by a mysterious curse, and the
            shop's traveling salesperson, Tomthal's cheerful sister Karaea.

            Compatibility
          </h2>
          <p>
            This mod works with <acronym title=
            "Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>: Shadows of Amn, with or without
            the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. If you do not have Throne of
            Bhaal installed, you will miss a few items available in that part
            of the game. Make sure your game has the latest patch. Check the
            ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the
            <a href="http://www.bioware.com/support/games/">BioWare</a> website
            if necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            This mod will also work with all mods, including <a href=
            "http://www.pocketplane.net/tutu/">Baldur's Gate Tutu</a> (and
            EasyTutu) and <a href=
            "http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=261">Baldur's Gate
            Trilogy</a>. Aurora and Tomthal will not appear in the
            <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 'To Two'">Tutu</acronym> version,
            but Karaea will.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aurora's Shoes is now compatible with the total conversion <a href=
            "http://ca.spellholdstudios.net">Classic Adventures</a> (Karaea
            travels to Westgate and the Suderham dungeons). In theory, it should
            also be compatible with <a href=
            "http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/rtt">Return to Trademeet</a>
            (Karaea also returns to Trademeet).
          </p>
          <p>
            This mod should go fairly late in a mod install order: ideally after
            patches and fixpacks and before final "biffing" routines. It
            should also go after other mods that add creatures and mods that
            overwrite rather than patch game resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want the (few) weapons in this mod to take the "Sensible
            Weapon Restrictions" from <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/aoe/">
            Ashes of Embers</a>, it doesn't matter whether you install Aurora
            before or after <acronym title="Ashes of Embers">AoE</acronym>. If
            you want the similar weapon tweaks in
            <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/level1npcs/">Level 1 NPCs</a>,
            however, install the latter mod after Aurora.
          </p>
          <p>
            We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> starting a new game before
            playing this mod, or you may miss a lot of content. In any case, you
            <strong>must not</strong> have visited the Bridge District or
            Nashkel before playing the mod, or you may experience game-breaking
            issues.

          <p>
            <em><strong>Note:</strong> If you've previously installed the mod,
            remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run
            <strong>setup-aurora.exe</strong> (or .command), uninstall all
            previously installed components and delete the aurora folder. When
            installing or uninstalling, do not close the <acronym title=
            "Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window by clicking on the
            <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the
            <strong>Enter</strong> key when instructed to do so.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Disconnect from the Internet and turn
            off any antivirus, firewall or other memory-resident software when
            installing this mod or any others. Not only will your installation
            go faster, but some antivirus packages report false errors with
            <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can extract files from the archive using <a href=

            "http://www.zipgenius.it/index.php?id=33">ZipGenius</a> or another
            file compression utility that handles .rar files.

            <strong>Windows</strong><br />
            Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish
            to modify (<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
            <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> or EasyTutu).
            On successful extraction, there should be an aurora folder and a
            setup-aurora.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply
            double-click <strong>setup-aurora.exe</strong> and follow the
            instructions on screen.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            <strong>Aurora's Shoes and Boots</strong><br />
            This is the main component described herein. However, you need not

            <strong>Small portraits for <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">
            NPCs</acronym></strong><br />
            <em>Requires main component</em><br />
            This component provides two options for installing portraits:<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The mod-added merchants, as well as
            a few other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Just the merchants Aurora, Tomthal
            and Karaea.<br />
            Of course, you can skip the portraits entirely if you prefer.

            <strong>Shorten Gorion battle cutscene</strong><br />
            <em>Non-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></em><br />
            This component is primarily a convenience for playtesting, but is 
            also for the player who's seen Gorion's battle one too many times.
            It will greatly shorten this, allowing you to start playing almost
            immediately after leaving Candlekeep. Everything else in the game
            is otherwise as if you had sat through it. When combined with the
            "Skip Candlekeep" component of
            <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/scs/ease.php">
            Sword Coast Stratagems</a>, you can be exploring the wilderness in

            This component is primarily a convenience for playtesting, but is 
            also for the player who's seen the opening cutscene in Irenicus's
            dungeon one too many times. It will shorten this and skip the
            linear talk with Imoen, allowing you to begin play immediately.
            Everything in the game is otherwise as if you had sat through all
            that. When combined with <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/dbg/">
            Dungeon-Be-Gone</a>, you can be within Athkatla in a matter of
            seconds, and just steps away from acquiring some new boots, if you
            can afford them. This component has three options:<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Shorten the opening cutscene in
            Irenicus's Dungeon.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Shorten both the opening cutscene
            and the subsequent battle between Irenicus and the Cowled Wizards
            in Waukeen's Promenade.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Shorten the previous two cutscenes
            and the Cowled Wizard scene that sends the player to Spellhold
            after talks with Gaelan Bayle.<br />

          <p>
            <strong>Change store buying prices</strong><br />
            This component is a revision of GeN1e's "Store Prices" mini-mod.
            While playing many different mods for Baldur's Gate, he noticed one
            unpleasant thing - almost every mod adds a certain number of new
            enemies who drop tons of expensive loot. If not creatures then areas
            with chests full of treasure. When playing a mega-mod combination,
            by chapter six he had around 600,000 coins! In the original game,
            that would hardly be more than 100,000. Faced with this lack of
            challenge, GeN1e started to lose interest in further playing. In
            order to avoid this, he started to ignore all new loot but it was
            hard, since he couldn't remember whether each coin came from the
            original game and thus could take more than desired.<br /><br />
            The second reason for this component: the author is the kind of
            person who (surprise!) tries to gather as much as possible. At least
            until it becomes boring. When learning to mod, GeN1e asked: why not
            make a mod which would greatly increase prices in stores and give a
            way to spend those millions? He liked this idea but soon realized it
            would be quite a crude method, though an effective one. Then why not
            decrease buying prices? It would eliminate the need for gathering
            loot - if heavy armor or swords (two-handed swords +1 for
            example) will bring only 10-20 coins from selling them to a merchant
            there is absolutely no pleasure in picking them up. Even better -
            increasing both buying and selling prices will make every item very
            valuable and coins something lacking value (inflation, if you don't
            know). Or quite the reverse, if you prefer: items cost nothing and
            only rewards in gold are of some interest.<br /><br />
            This component allows you to reduce the prices at which stores buy
            items, anywhere down to 25%, or raise them up to 300%. It will, of
            course, affect Aurora's items and those of any other mod installed
            before this one. The recommended value for a typical mega-mod
            install is a reduction to 67% (two-thirds of the original values).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Change store selling prices</strong><br />
            As above, this component is also from the "Store Prices" mini-mod.
            It allows you to reduce the prices at which stores sell
            items, anywhere down to 50%, or raise them up to 500%. It will
            affect Aurora's items and those of any other mod installed
            previously. The recommended value for a typical mega-mod
            install is an increase to 150%.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Change gem and jewelry prices</strong><br />
            Based on the "Store Prices" mini-mod (but not included in it), this
            component allows you to change the prices of gems and non-magical
            necklaces and rings. Since these are almost always gained as loot,
            this will change the total gold acquired. It will stack with the
            components above, if those are also installed. The component will
            reduce gem and jewelry prices anywhere down to 10%, or raise them
            up to 200%. The recommended value for a typical mega-mod install is
            a reduction to 67% (though as a new component, this requires
            confirmation).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Change quest gold rewards</strong><br />
            Based on the "Store Prices" mini-mod and the <a href=
            "http://www.pocketplane.net/sim">Ding0 Experience Fixer</a>, this
            component allows you to change the gold gained from quest rewards
            and other interactions with <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">
            NPCs</acronym>. It should work with standard game quests as well as
            most mod-added content, including Aurora. It changes amounts
            mentioned in dialogues as well as actual rewards obtained.
            Furthermore, it fixes buggy behavior where some
            <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> may not have
            enough gold on hand to give the rewards they promised (unless
            intended by their dialogues). It is fully compatible with the next
            component (Change creature gold carried) in that respect. However,
            in the interest of efficiency, it will not affect rewards under 100
            gold, and only a few that are equal to 100 gold (where it makes
            sense to change those). Choices vary anywhere from 10% to 90% of the
            original quest rewards. Alternately, you can choose not to modify
            the actual rewards but just implement the fixes described above.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Realistic random treasures</strong><br />
            Many creatures in the game carry items that give them chances for
            spawning random treasures of various types. Many players have
            objected to the looting of high-level magical scrolls from
            gnolls, ogres and other creatures typically not magically inclined,
            or even literate in some cases. This component changes that. It
            excludes creatures of certain classes from obtaining scrolls, though
            they can spawn other random treasures such as gems or jewelry.
            The excluded creatures are basilisks, ghouls, revenants, mummies,
            gnolls, all ogre variants except ogre magi, beholders, trolls,
            umber hulks, mist creatures, fire elementals and zombies.
            Furthermore, it excludes summoned creatures and those with
            an intelligence less than 10. Though this is purely an arbitrary
            cut-off, it has the effect of excluding most humanoid rabble (such
            as kobolds and orcs) from possessing scrolls, <em>unless</em> they
            are spellcasters or other literate types. To account for this,
            certain creatures get a minor intelligence boost or decrease as
            relevant. This should have no other noticeable effect in the game.
            <br /><br />
            This component also fixes weighting and other issues with the random
            treasure tables. For example, "poor" creatures should not have
            scrolls worth upwards of 100 gold under any circumstances. It
            provides several options for installation:<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Remove duplicate random treasures<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Only intelligent creatures get
            random scrolls<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Both 1 and 2 (no treasures lost)<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Both 1 and 2 (25% of treasures
            lost)<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Both 1 and 2 (50% of treasures
            lost)<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Both 1 and 7 (75% of treasures
            lost)<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. All random treasures removed<br /><br />
            With the first option (included also in options 3 through 6), all
            creatures with more than one random treasure will be left with the
            last one in their inventories. At best, this was simply too much
            loot for the affected creatures. At worst, it was quite possibly a
            bug, since some creatures referenced a single item more than once
            for no apparent reason. The exceptions to this rule are dragons and
            liches, who can possess multiple random treasures, as one might
            expect.<br /><br />
            The second option (also included in options 3 through 6) is the main
            feature described above. The third option combines the first two
            options and is probably the option of choice for most lightly-
            modded games.<br /><br />
            Options four through six also combine both features. In addition,
            they give a random chance for treasure "loss." With option 4, one
            out of every four creatures who previously had a random treasure
            will no longer have one. Option 5 increases this to a 1-in-2 chance,
            whereas with option 6, three out of four creatures will have lost
            their random loot. These options are probably appropriate for large
            mega-mod installs. Option 7 is the most extreme, removing all
            random loot in the game. Note that none of these options affects
            <em>specific</em> treasures that creatures will always have. It only
            affects <em>random</em> treasures that vary from game to game.<br /><br />
            This component requires at least three rows to be vacant in either
            your random treasure table (rndtreas.2da) or random magic table
            (rndmagic.2da), though it will install partially if the tables are
            full. The only known configuration where this happens is when
            <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/ctb">Check the Bodies</a>
            is installed <em>after</em> <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">
            BGT</acronym>. The recommended order, however, is to install
            <acronym title="Check the Bodies">CtB</acronym> <em>before</em>
            <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Change creature gold carried</strong><br />
            Based on the "Store Prices" mini-mod (but not included in it), this
            component allows you to change the gold carried by creatures and
            thus gained as loot. It will reduce creature gold anywhere down to
            10%, or raise the values up to 200%. The recommended value for a
            typical mega-mod install is a reduction to 50% (though as a new
            component, this requires confirmation). It will also affect random
            amounts of gold spawned by the treasure tables and is fully
            compatible with the previous component in that respect.

            An offshoot of the "Realistic random treasures" component, this
            selection makes the fearsome animated armor suits closer to their
            paper-and-pencil incarnations. They are now immune to ability drain,
            level drain, hold, fear and other mind-based spells. As they possess
            the <em>Air Walk</em> ability, they are not hindered by spells like
            Grease and Web. Horrors are immune to Magic Missile, Fireball,
            Lightning Bolt and Ice Storm, as well as necromancy spells.
            They see invisible beings naturally. Horrors use missile weapons,
            typically crossbows. They can also imbue their melee weapons with a
            magical flame, though the weapons themselves are usually normal. In
            addition, Battle Horrors possess spell-like abilities that include
            Magic Missile and Dimension Door.<br /><br />
            This component will affect the Helmed and Battle Horrors found in
            <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 'To Two'">Tutu</acronym> and
            <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>. It will also
            affect the Doomsayer and certain protectors of Durlag's Tower (as
            discussed in <a href=

            <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym></a> makes to
            Horrors, which are of a different nature. It will be skipped for
            <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, unless it detects
            a mod that adds Horrors, such as <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/quest">
            Quest Pack</a> or <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showtopic=24405">
            Planar Sphere</a>. The Horrors get unique animations if you have a
            <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> executable. If not,
            we recommend installing the <a href=
            "http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showtopic=36581">Flaming Swords</a>
            component from One Pixel Productions, so Battle Horrors will have
            properly-animated weapons. It can be installed either before or
            after this component.

            <strong>Realistic Kobold Commandos</strong><br />
            An offshoot of the "Realistic random treasures" component, this
            selection makes these cheating little buggers a bit more realistic,
            as discussed in <a href=
            "http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?s=&showtopic=14927&view=findpost&p=127944">this
            thread</a>. While Kobold Commandos have no <acronym title=
            "Paper-and-Pencil">PnP</acronym> equivalents, this component gives
            them values closer to kobold bodyguards per <acronym title=
            "Paper-and-Pencil">PnP</acronym> rules. Specifically, it changes
            Arrows of Fire to conform to their default descriptions and what you
            would expect of nonmagical flaming projectiles. They now do just 1d2
            extra fire damage which is not subject to a saving throw. The
            commandos will have only two flaming arrows (though they have full
            quivers of normal arrows), so it behooves you to kill the (formerly
            cheating) little buggers as quickly as possible. In compensation,
            they get slightly better saving throws and proficiency bonuses
            (two stars in short swords and short bows) as appropriate for
            first-level warriors. It is compatible with the Kobold Commandos
            changed or added by <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/scs/">

          <h2>
            Frequently Asked Questions
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: Who is Aurora? What is she doing in
            Athkatla?</strong><br />
            A: Aurora is a retired fighter who loves shoes. She spent her early
            years combining her love of adventure with her love for shoes,
            fighting wherever a hired sword was needed and buying new and
            exotic footgear (when she had the money). Eventually, feeling the
            need for a more settled life, she rented a booth in Athkatla's
            Bridge District and opened her own shoe shop. With her far-flung
            acquaintance and knowledge of distant lands, she is able to sell
            unique items available through no other merchant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her passion for gossip nearly matches her love for shoes, and
            she'll be glad to share the news of the town with anyone who asks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: Wait, where do Tomthal and Karaea come in?</strong><br />
            A: Aurora cannot be at the shoe shop all the time. During the night
            hours, Tomthal runs the shop. He is a svirfneblin doomed to live on
            the surface because of a curse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Karaea is his sister, a cheerful traveling merchant whom you may
            meet in Trademeet and perhaps in Nashkel and Amkethran as well.
            While Aurora and Tomthal both sleep when they're not minding the
            shop, Karaea has learned the reverie skill from an elf friend. At
            night, she meditates in a private garden but will still sell items
            if roused.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: Did someone mention a quest?</strong><br />
            A: Yes and no. Aurora, Tomthal and/or Karaea may ask the party to
            do a favor or two.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: What about new areas?</strong><br />
            A: Funny you should ask. Rumor has it there are bands of goblins
            roaming the wilds - some perhaps are even holed up in new caves
            for the intrepid party to discover. You may also find the off-duty
            lairs of the merchants in their respective districts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: Just how much conversation are we talking
            about?</strong><br />
            A: Aurora has twenty-some bits of gossip to pass on (if you ask),
            one or two banters with all the BioWare <acronym title=
            "Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> and a handful of banters
            with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>. Tomthal
            and Karaea have lesser amounts of dialogue, though specific to
            their characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also a small amount of crossmod material if you have the <a href=
            "http://www.teambg.eu/forum/index.php?topic=942.0">MTS Crappack</a>
            or <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=579">Tales
            of the Deep Gardens</a> installed. Eventually, there will be
            additional material available through <a href=
            "http://www.gibberlings3.net/crossmod/">Crossmod</a>, including
            banters with Solaufein, Kelsey, Hubelpot and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: And how many pairs of shoes?</strong><br />
            There are over three dozen pairs of boots of various kinds. You can
            buy most of these from the merchants, or merge them with other boots
            to create upgraded footwear. You may come across other items as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: Why can't I find all the items?</strong><br />
            A: You must try harder, grasshopper ;). Several of the items are
            truly random, and some of those are quite rare also. Sheer volume
            in defeating enemies may prove to be the key. Other items are
            obtained only under special circumstances or on certain platforms.
            Still other items appear in stores other than Aurora's - these are
            also random.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q: What if I don't want a chatty shopkeeper?</strong><br />
            A: If you don't want to chat with Aurora yourself and do not want
            to hear her conversations with the <acronym title=
            "Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, tell her you never want to
            hear from her, ever again, and the dialogue reverts to standard
            shopkeep-talk. You can also apologize for telling her to shut up and
            get more gossip from her, if you like.

            Troubleshooting
          </h2>
          <p>
            These are some general tips if you have problems getting the game
            working, with or without this or other mods. Many times, errors have
            to do with the game engine itself or the manner of installation or
            gameplay. The game recommends deleting all files out of the /cache,
            /temp and /tempsave subfolders in your game folder to see if that
            resolves the problem before any further troubleshooting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Symptom: Game freezes or crashes to desktop (CTDs)</strong>
            <br />
            Sometimes the game displays an "assertion error" in a pop-up window
            when this happens, but often times it doesn't. To enable the full
            error message, open the file <strong>baldur.ini</strong> in your
            game folder with a text editor (such as Notepad). If you find you
            can't edit it or save changes in Windows Vista, see <a href=
            "http://forums.bioware.com/viewtopic.html?topic=662080&forum=10">
            this topic</a> for assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the [Program Options] section in the file, type <strong>
            Logging On=1</strong> (unless it's already there). While you're
            there, you may also want to make sure <strong>Debug Mode=1</strong>
            is there to enable the <a href=
            "http://iesdp.gibberlings3.net/clua/bg2.htm">CLUA Console</a> for
            debugging and testing. Save the file and exit. Now go back into the
            game and try to reproduce the crash. Then look in your game folder
            again for the <strong>Baldur.err</strong> file and open it with a
            text editor to analyze its contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Symptom: Game crashes with no Baldur.err log and shows
            either a black screen or a pop-up window indicating an error at
            offset 005ca8a8</strong>
            <br />
            This usually indicates an animation-related issue. Make sure you
            have the latest version of the mod. If you've installed other mods
            after it and have this issue, install the fix available <a href=
            http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=884>here</a>.
          </p>

            <strong>ERROR: error copying [aurora/bam/somefile.bam]<br />
            ERROR: [SOMEFILE.CRE] -> [override/SOMEFILE.CRE] Patching failed
            (COPY)<br />
            Stopping installation because of error.</strong> (with no other
            error message)<br />
            Less-than-informative messages like these may indicate you're
            installing to a hard drive with a low data transfer rate or an
            antivirus program is active during installation (which can also
            affect data transfer). Try installing to an internal drive with
            antivirus protection disabled during the install. If unsure,
            disconnect from the Internet (either unplug your network cable or
            disable your wireless adaptor) and turn off <strong>all</strong>
            memory-resident programs during the install. To get a list of these,
            go to Start > Run and type <strong>msconfig</strong> where it says
            "Open:" then click OK. When the System Configuration Utility appears,
            click on the Startup tab. The only really necessary programs that
            need to be loaded in memory at startup are those related to your
            graphics chip (typically ATI or NVIDIA). Uncheck everything else,
            reboot and try installing the mod again. There are well-documented
            issues with installing mods while Avast antivirus is running, so
            make absolutely sure all components of Avast are completely disabled.

            Msg: c:\{path}\bg2\cd#\DATA\BIFNAME.BIF: attempted to use compressed
            BIF from CD, check free hard drive space
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, the referenced BIF will exist, but the game expects it to
            be in your main \data folder or in \cache\data. Copying it from the
            cd# folder (or the CD itself) will sometimes work. Other times, you
            may need to use <a href=
            "http://www.gibberlings3.net/tools/dltcep.php"><acronym title=
            "Dragonlance Total Conversion Editor Pro">DLTCEP</acronym></a> to
            decompress the BIF. To do this, go to <strong>Extraction >
            Uncompress BIF</strong>. The decompressed BIF should end up in your
            main \data folder. Relaunch the game and see if this resolves the
            issue.
          </p>

          <p>
            Usually, this means you have installed the mod and used a saved
            game in which you've already visited an area changed by the mod.
            You need to use a save from before this point, or preferably, start
            a new game.

            <strong>BEHHIV01.CRE is corrupt: below minimum length
            </strong><br />
            Messages of this nature usually indicate you're installing this on
            Shadows of Amn instead of Throne of Bhaal. Some older mods use an
            ALLOW_MISSING command to create zero-byte files which aren't
            present. You can safely ignore such messages. You'll never see those
            files, and this mod won't try to patch them.

            resolves your issue, or you have mod-specific issues, please report
            the problem in the mod's <a href=
